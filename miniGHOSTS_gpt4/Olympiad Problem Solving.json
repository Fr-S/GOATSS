The statement might sound logical given our traditional understanding of geometrical shapes, but a counterintuitive and surprising result exists within the realm of mathematical research: it is indeed possible to divide a cube into a number of smaller, distinct (not identical) cubes.\n\nThis mathematical curiosity is known as the 'Perfect Cube Dissection' or 'Cube Packing', and is related to the broader area of 'Packing Problems' in mathematics. It asks whether a given shape can be dissected (i.e., divided without gaps or overlaps) into smaller distinct shapes of the same type.\n\nThe first successful proof for cubes was presented by Roland Sprague in 1939. He demonstrated that a cube can be dissected into 22 distinct smaller cubes. In 1969, another solution with 23 cubes was discovered. However, no solutions are known with 24 through 31 cubes, and there are solutions known for some numbers greater than 31. The smallest number for which no solution is known is 24.\n\nSo, it is mathematically proven that a cube can indeed be divided into several smaller distinct cubes.",

        "output": "The question appears to be referring to a mathematical proof, specifically a problem in combinatorial geometry.\n\nLet's assume we are using two colors, say red and blue, to color the plane. The problem can be proved using the Pigeonhole Principle, which essentially states that if n items are put into m containers, with n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one item.\n\nIn our problem, a regular triangle is one where all three sides are equal. This is the triangle we need to prove exists within a two-color plane.\n\nTo prove this, let's start with an equilateral triangle ABC in the plane, with each corner being a different point. The side length of this triangle doesn't matter.\n\nWe don't know how the plane is colored, so we can only assume that each vertex of our triangle could be either red or blue. That means each vertex has 2 possibilities for its color - hence for the whole triangle there are 2^3 = 8 possibilities for the coloring of the vertices.\n\nNow, consider four points: A, B, C, and D in the plane. If you think about all possible ways of drawing three points from a set of four, there are four possible combinations: ABC, ABD, ACD, and BCD.\n\nDue to the Pigeonhole Principle, among these four triangles (with vertices selected from A, B, C, D), there must exist at least two triangles having vertices of the same color combination. If any of these triangles has vertices all of the same color, we're done: it's a regular triangle with vertices of the same color.\n\nIf not, the only possible ways to color these two triangles would be:\n\nOne vertex is of one color and the other two vertices are of another color.\nEach vertex is of a different color.\nGiven that we only have two colors, option 2 is not possible. This leads to option 1 being the only possibility. But if two triangles share a vertex and have the same color combination under these conditions, they must each have a different colored vertex that isn't shared. This leads to an inherent contradiction, because the two triangles would then have to share a color at that vertex, meaning that all three vertices of these triangles are of the same color.\n\nThis proof shows that, in a plane colored with two colors, there will always exist three points of the same color, which are the vertices of a regular triangle.",

Now, think of the equator as a big circle and the sphere as a ball.\nDivide this equator into four equal parts using four points: A, B, C, and D in clockwise order.\nThese four points will form two equilateral triangles on the plane of the equator, ABC and BCD.\nBecause we have two colors and four points, at least one color must be repeated among these four points according to the pigeonhole principle.\nLet's say points A and B are the same color.\nNow, let's consider the poles of the sphere. Call them P (North Pole) and Q (South Pole).\nIf either P or Q is the same color as points A and B, we've found our regular triangle. Let's say P, A, and B form this regular triangle if P is the same color as A and B.\nIf both P and Q are not the same color as A and B, then P and Q must be the same color (since there are only two colors).\nIn this case, we can form a regular triangle with points P, C, and D or Q, C, and D, since C and D are the same color, and either P or Q will match this color.\nTherefore, in either case, we've proven that there exist three points of the same color that form the vertices of a regular triangle on a sphere, regardless of how the sphere is colored with two colors.\nRemember that this proof is built on some assumptions:\n\nA regular triangle is an equilateral triangle (all sides are of equal length).\n\"Point\" refers to any location on the sphere, not just specific dots or marks.\nThe colors can be distributed in any way, but there can be no area that is a blend of the two colorsâevery point must be one color or the other.\nThe sphere is perfectly symmetrical, with no distortions or irregularities.\nWe are working with a 3D sphere, not a 2D circle.",
