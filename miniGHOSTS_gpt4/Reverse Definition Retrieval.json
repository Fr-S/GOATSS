When a function fails to be smooth, it might exhibit jumps, discontinuities, or sharp points.\n\nFor more advanced mathematical contexts, one might discuss the regularity of the function, and use terms like \"irregular points\" or \"singular points,\" referring to points where the function behaves in a non-typical or pathological manner.\n\nPlease note, however, that these terms can have different meanings in different contexts, and their precise definitions can depend on the specific field of mathematics or science in which they are used.

The term \"partition of unity\" is usually used in a more general sense where the functions just need to be continuous and sum to 1 over their domain. So if you specifically need the functions to be nonnegative, you may need to specify that as a condition.\n\nAlternatively, if you're working within the context of probability theory, such a collection of functions could form a discrete probability distribution if the domain is countable, or a probability density function if the domain is continuous.",

A single seminorm doesn't usually generate a topology that's worth discussing on its own. If you have a vector space and a single seminorm, that's usually not enough to define a topological vector space because a seminorm is allowed to be zero at more places than just the origin.\n\nOn the other hand, a family of seminorms can generate a topology on the vector space. This family of seminorms induces a topology known as the initial topology or the weakest topology which makes all the seminorms continuous. This topology is often referred to as the seminorm topology.\n\nThe resulting topological space is a locally convex topological vector space. This comes from the fact that each seminorm ball (a type of neighborhood around the origin) is convex, and by taking intersections of such balls from different seminorms, we can get a local base for the topology at the origin. The space is then often called a locally convex space or a locally convex topological vector space.\n\nSo in conclusion, a topological space whose topology is generated by a family of seminorms can be called a seminormed space, but it's often more useful to think of it as a locally convex topological vector space.",
