However, since the order in which the meerkats stand guard does not matter (that is, Meerkat A standing guard with Meerkat B is the same as Meerkat B standing guard with Meerkat A), we have counted each unique pair twice.\nTo correct for this, we need to divide the total number of pairs by $2$.

Therefore, the number of \"sleeping slots\" available is $45 \\times (10 - 2) = 45 \\times 8 = 360$.\nSince there are $10$ meerkats and we want to know how many nights each one gets to sleep, we divide the total number of \"sleeping slots\" by the number of meerkats: $360/10 = 36$.\nSo, during that period, each meerkat gets $36$ nights of sleep.",

        "output": "\nSure, let's fill in the missing steps for this problem:\n\nA rhombus is a type of quadrilateral that has all sides of equal length. Since the perimeter (the sum of all sides) of the rhombus is given as 68 units, and we know that a rhombus has 4 equal sides, we can find the length of each side by dividing the perimeter by 4:\n\n68 units ÷ 4 = 17 units.\n\nSo, each side of the rhombus is 17 units long.\n\nIn a rhombus, the diagonals are perpendicular and they bisect each other, forming four right triangles inside the rhombus. Since one of the diagonals is given as 30 units, each half of this diagonal is 30 units ÷ 2 = 15 units. This forms one leg of each right triangle.\n\nTo find the length of the other leg of the right triangle (which is half of the other diagonal), we can use the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in any right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. We can write this as:\n\n17^2 = 15^2 + b^2,\n\nwhere b represents the other leg of the triangle.

Substituting the full lengths of our diagonals into the formula (remember, we've been dealing with half-diagonals, so we need to multiply them by 2), we get:\n\nArea = (30 * 16) / 2 = 240 square units.\n\nSo, the area of the rhombus is 240 square units.",

        "comment": "Level_2 \nCompletion type: proof only \n Official solution: We can solve this with a Venn diagram.  First we notice that there are 20 people with both yoga mats and water bottles. [asy]\nlabel(\"Yoga Mat\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"Water Bottle\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$20$\", (44, 45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$33$\",(28,45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$23$\",(63,45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15));\n[/asy] Since 36 people brought yoga mats and 20 of those people brought water bottles too, $36-20=16$ of the people have yoga mats but not water bottles.  Likewise, $26-20=6$ people brought water bottles but not yoga mats. [asy]\nlabel(\"Yoga Mat\", (2,75));\nlabel(\"Water Bottle\", (80,75));\ndraw(Circle((30,45), 22));\ndraw(Circle((58, 45), 22));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$20$\", (44, 45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$16$\",(28,45));\nlabel(scale(0.8)*\"$6$\",(63,45));\n//label(scale(0.8)*\"$17$\", (70, 15));\n[/asy] This means that $16+20+6=42$ people brought at least one of the two items.  That's everybody!  Therefore $\\boxed{0}$ people had to suffer without a water bottle or yoga mat.",
