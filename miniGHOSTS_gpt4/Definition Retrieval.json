        "output": "Sure, I'd be happy to provide a formal definition of a Sobolev space.\n\nSobolev spaces are functional spaces of functions admitting weak derivatives up to a certain order. They are named after the Russian mathematician Sergei Sobolev. Its utility in the theory of partial differential equations is that it often includes the solutions to various PDEs.\n\nHere's the definition for a basic Sobolev space:\n\nLet Ω be an open subset of ℝ^n. The Sobolev space W^{k,p}(Ω) (or H^{k,p}(Ω) in some notations), consists of all functions u such that each derivative of u with order less than or equal to k is in L^p(Ω), the Lebesgue space of p-integrable functions.\n\nMore precisely, if α is a multi-index with |α| ≤ k, then the α-th derivative D^αu of u must be a function in L^p(Ω).\n\nHere, α is a multi-index notation, a way of denoting higher-dimensional derivatives in a concise way. |α| is the total order of the derivative, and D^α is the derivative operator corresponding to α.\n\nThe norm on W^{k,p}(Ω) is typically defined as follows:\n\n||u||{W^{k,p}(Ω)} = (Σ{|α| ≤ k} ||D^αu||_{L^p(Ω)}^p)^(1/p)\n\nif 1 ≤ p < ∞, and\n\n||u||{W^{k,∞}(Ω)} = max{|α| ≤ k} ||D^αu||_{L^∞(Ω)}\n\nif p = ∞.\n\nThe Sobolev space W^{k,p}(Ω) is then a Banach space with this norm.\n\nWhen p=2, these spaces are Hilbert spaces and denoted as H^k(Ω), and the norm is defined similarly but it includes the square root at the end due to the property of the L^2 space.\n\nAs a final note, the Sobolev spaces are important because of the Sobolev Embedding Theorem, which describes conditions under which a Sobolev space may be continuously embedded into another space, and the Rellich-Kondrachov theorem which gives conditions under which this embedding is compact.",

        "output": "The adjoint of a bounded operator in a Hilbert space is well-defined, but for unbounded operators, the situation is a bit more subtle. First, a brief refresher on the definition of an adjoint for a bounded operator.\n\nLet H and K be Hilbert spaces over the complex numbers and let A: H → K be a bounded linear operator. The adjoint of A, denoted by A*, is the unique bounded linear operator from K to H such that, for all x in H and y in K, the following equality holds:\n\n⟨Ax, y⟩_K = ⟨x, A*y⟩_H\n\nwhere ⟨ , ⟩ denotes the inner product in the corresponding Hilbert space.\n\nIn the case of unbounded operators, the definition is more involved and requires the notion of the domain of an operator.\n\nLet A be an unbounded operator on a Hilbert space H. The domain of A, denoted by Dom(A), is a dense subset of H, meaning that its closure is the entire space H. The operator A assigns to each element φ of Dom(A) an element Aφ of H.\n\nThe adjoint of A, denoted by A*, is defined as follows:\n\nThe domain Dom(A*) of A* consists of all ψ in H such that the map φ ↦ ⟨Aφ, ψ⟩ is a bounded linear functional on Dom(A). For ψ in Dom(A*), A*ψ is the unique element of H such that, for all φ in Dom(A), the following equality holds:\n\n⟨Aφ, ψ⟩ = ⟨φ, A*ψ⟩\n\nThis might seem more abstract than the definition for bounded operators, but it is necessary to deal with the complications arising from unboundedness. Some unbounded operators do not have an adjoint, but when they do, the adjoint has nice properties that generalize those of the adjoint of a bounded operator. Note, however, that the domain of an unbounded operator and its adjoint can be quite different. The adjoint of an unbounded operator is always closed (meaning that if a sequence in the domain of the adjoint converges and its image under the adjoint also converges, then the limit of the sequence is in the domain of the adjoint), and an unbounded operator is closed if and only if its adjoint is densely defined (meaning that the closure of its domain is the entire space H).",

Compact operators are very similar to finite-dimensional linear transformations, in a certain sense, and they have many of the nice properties that finite-dimensional operators do.\n\nPlease note that compactness of an operator is not equivalent to boundedness of the operator, although every compact operator is bounded.",
