Here, $V_1 + V_2 = {h + k: h in V_1, k in V_2}$.\n\nLet $U = V(f+g, r)$ for some $r > 0$. We need to find open sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ such that their sum is contained in $U$. Choose $V_1 = V(f, r/2)$ and $V_2 = V(g, r/2)$. Now, let $h in V_1$ and $k in V_2$. By the definition of the sets $V_1$ and $V_2$, we have:\n\n|h(x) - f(x)| < \\frac{r}{2} quad \\text{and} quad |k(x) - g(x)| < \\frac{r}{2}\n \n\nfor all $x in (0, 1)$. Now, consider the sum $h+k$.

Since this holds for arbitrary $h in V_1$ and $k in V_2$, we have $(V_1 + V_2) subseteq U$. Thus, addition is $au$-continuous.\n\nNow, we will show that scalar multiplication is not $au$-continuous. Consider the function $f(x) = x$ and let $c \\neq 0$ be a scalar. Suppose scalar multiplication is continuous. Then, for any open set $U$ containing $cf$, there should exist an open set $V$ containing $f$ and an open set $W$ containing $c$ in the standard topology on $mathbb{R}$ such that $(V, W) subseteq U$ (in the product topology).

This implies that $dh in U$ when $d = c$. However, if we choose a different $d in W$ such that $d \\neq c$, we cannot guarantee that $|(dh)(x) - (cf)(x)| < r$ for all $x in (0, 1)$. In fact, for a sufficiently small neighborhood $W$ of $c$, there exists a $d in W$ such that $|(dh)(x) - (cf)(x)| geq r$ for some $x in (0, 1)$, showing that $(V, W) \n\\subseteq U$.

In addition the choice of alpha_n is not particularly smart. The argument would work if choosing alpha_n = n though, which is why one point above the lowest grade is awarded.",

We can express $z$ as $z = (s + t)a$ for some $a in A$.\n\nSince $A$ is convex, we know that for any $a in A$ and any scalars $s, t in [0, 1]$ such that $s + t = 1$, we have $sx + ty in A$. Let's consider $x = y = a$. Then we have:\n\n$z = (s + t)a = sa + ta$\n\nSo, $z in sA + tA$. Thus, $(s + t)A subseteq sA + tA$.\n\nNow, let's consider any point $z in sA + tA$.

Then, since $(s + t)A = sA + tA$, we have:\n\n$sx + ty in sA + tA = (s + t)A = A$\n\nSo, for any two points $x, y in A$ and any scalars $s, t in [0, 1]$ such that $s + t = 1$, we have $sx + ty in A$. This means that $A$ is convex.\n\nIn conclusion, we have shown that $A$ is convex if and only if $(s + t)A = sA",

Since $X$ is a vector space, it has an additive inverse for every element. So, there exists an element $-x in X$ such that $x + (-x) = 0$, where $0$ is the additive identity in the vector space.\n\nNow, we want to find $z$ such that $x + z = y$. We can rewrite this equation as $z = y + (-x)$. Since $X$ is a vector space and closed under addition, the sum of any two elements in $X$ is also in $X$. Therefore, $z = y + (-x) in X$.\n\nSo, we have shown the existence of a $z in X$ such that $x + z = y$.\n\nUniqueness:\n\nAssume there are two distinct elements $z_1, z_2 in X$ such that $x + z_1 = y$ and $x + z_2 = y$. We want to show that $z_1 = z_2$.\n\nUsing the properties of a vector space, we can manipulate the equations:\n\n$x + z_1 = y$\n$-x + (x + z_1) = -x + y$\n$(-x + x) + z_1 = -x + y$\n$0 + z_1 = -x + y$\n$z_1 = -x + y$\n\nSimilarly,\n\n$z_2 = -x + y$\n\nSince both $z_1$ and $z_2$ are equal to $-x + y$, we have:\n\n$z_1 = z_2$\n\nThus, we have shown the uniqueness of $z$.\n\nIn conclusion, for any $x, y in X$, there exists a unique $z in X$ such that $x + z = y$.",
