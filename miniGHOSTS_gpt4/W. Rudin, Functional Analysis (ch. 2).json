Here $B: \\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^2$ is defined by $B(x_1, x_2; y) = (x_1 y, x_2 y)$. It's easy to see that B is linear in each of its arguments.

Similarly, if you fix $y$, then B is linear in $(x_1, x_2)$.\n\nContinuous: Linear (and hence bilinear) maps between finite dimensional spaces are always continuous, as they preserve the topology. In other words, linear transformations map open sets to open sets, closed sets to closed sets, etc. This is a general property of linear maps.\n\nNot open at $(1, 1; 0)$: To show that B is not open at a certain point, we need to find an open set in the domain which is not mapped to an open set in the co-domain. Here, any open ball around $(1, 1; 0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2 \\times \\mathbb{R}$ will be mapped to the single point $(0,0)$ in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is not an open set. Therefore, B is not open at $(1, 1; 0)$.\n\nFind all points where B is open: To answer this, we need to find all points $(x_1, x_2; y)$ such that B is open at that point. As we showed earlier, if $y=0$, then B is not open at $(x_1, x_2; 0)$, regardless of the values of $x_1$ and $x_2$. On the other hand, if $y\\neq 0$, then for any open set in the domain containing $(x_1, x_2; y)$, its image under B will also be open in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. This is because when $y\\neq 0$, the function B behaves like a scaling operation in $\\mathbb{R}^2$, which is an open map. Therefore, B is open at all points of the form $(x_1, x_2; y)$ with $y\\neq 0$.",

A set $A$ in a metric space is nowhere dense if its closure has an empty interior.\n\nWe start by defining the sets $F_n$ = {$f$ in $L^2$ : $||f||_2$ ≤ $n$}, where $n$ is a natural number. $F_n$ is the closed ball of radius $n$ centered at the origin in the $L^2$ norm.\n\nThen $L^2 = \\bigcup_{n=1}^{\\infty} F_n$, because any function in $L^2$ must have a finite $L^2$ norm, which means it must be in one of the $F_n$.\n\nEach $F_n$ is closed in $L^2$ (since it's a closed ball), and the inclusion map $i$ : $L^2$ → $L^1$ is continuous, so $i(F_n)$ is closed in $L^1$ (the image of a closed set under a continuous function is closed).\n\nBut $i(F_n)$ cannot contain an open ball in the $L^1$ metric, because if it did, there would be a function $f$ in $L^1$ such that $f$ is not in $L^2$ (since the inclusion map is not onto), but every function in $L^1$ that is \"close enough\" to $f$ in the $L^1$ metric is in $L^2$ (since it's in the open ball), which is a contradiction.\n\nTherefore, $i(F_n)$ is nowhere dense in $L^1$.

If we have a sequence of polynomials f_n converging to f in norm (which in this space means in the L^1 norm), then given a fixed g, B(f_n, g) = ∫_0^1 f_n(t)g(t) dt tends to ∫_0^1 f(t)g(t) dt = B(f, g) as n goes to infinity, by the dominated convergence theorem. Similarly, if we fix f and let g_n tend to g in norm, then B(f, g_n) tends to B(f, g).\n\nSo B is separately continuous.\n\nJoint Continuity\n\nJoint continuity means that B is continuous at every point of X x X when we equip X x X with the product topology. In our case, it is equivalent to the condition that for any sequences (f_n), (g_n) in X such that f_n tends to f and g_n tends to g in norm, we have B(f_n, g_n) tending to B(f, g).\n\nHowever, it is well-known and can be shown that B is not jointly continuous in this normed space. A counterexample can be constructed as follows:\n\nTake f_n(t) = n^(1/2) for 0 <= t <= 1/n and f_n(t) = 0 otherwise. Also, take g_n = f_n for all n. Clearly, ||f_n|| = ||g_n|| = 1 for all n, so they don't converge to 0 in norm. However, B(f_n, g_n) = ∫_0^1 f_n(t)g_n(t) dt = ∫_0^(1/n) n dt = 1 for all n, whereas B(f, g) = 0 for any pair of distinct f and g.\n\nHence, B is not jointly continuous.\n\nIn summary, B is a bilinear functional on X x X, it is separately continuous but it's not jointly continuous.",

        "output": "We want to show that C, the set of all x in X such that the sequence {Λ_n(x)} is a Cauchy sequence in Y, is a closed subspace of X. A set C is closed if its complement in the space X, denoted by X \\ C, is open. Recall that a subset U of a topological space X is open if for every x in U, there is an open neighborhood N of x that is completely contained in U.\n\nFirstly, note that C is indeed a subspace of X. It contains the zero vector, because {Λ_n(0)} = 0 is certainly a Cauchy sequence. It is also closed under addition and scalar multiplication, because if {Λ_n(x)} and {Λ_n(y)} are Cauchy sequences, then so are {Λ_n(x+y)} and {cΛ_n(x)}, for any real number c, due to the linearity of Λ_n and the properties of Cauchy sequences.\n\nNow, we show that C is closed by showing that its complement is open.\n\nLet x be in X \\ C, meaning {Λ_n(x)} is not a Cauchy sequence. Since Λ_n is equicontinuous, for each ε > 0, there exists a neighborhood N of x such that for all y in N and all n, |Λ_n(y) - Λ_n(x)| < ε.\n\nNow, since {Λ_n(x)} is not a Cauchy sequence, there exists some ε > 0 such that for all N, there exist m, n > N with |Λ_m(x) - Λ_n(x)| ≥ ε. In particular, this means that there exist m, n such that |Λ_m(x) - Λ_n(x)| ≥ 3ε.\n\nLet y be in the neighborhood N of x defined above. Then we have |Λ_m(y) - Λ_n(y)| ≤ |Λ_m(y) - Λ_m(x)| + |Λ_m(x) - Λ_n(x)| + |Λ_n(x) - Λ_n(y)| < ε + 3ε + ε = 5ε, by the triangle inequality.\n\nThis means that if y is close enough to x (i.e., in the neighborhood N), then {Λ_n(y)} cannot be a Cauchy sequence, because we have found m, n with |Λ_m(y) - Λ_n(y)| > ε. Thus, y is also in X \\ C.\n\nTherefore, every x in X \\ C is contained in an open set of points also in X \\ C, so X \\ C is open. Hence, C is a closed subspace of X.",
