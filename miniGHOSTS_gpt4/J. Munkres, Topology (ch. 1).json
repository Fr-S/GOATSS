        "output": "Before proceeding, let's define what contrapositive and converse of a statement mean:\n\nThe contrapositive of a statement of the form \"If P then Q\" is \"If not Q then not P\".\nThe converse of a statement of the form \"If P then Q\" is \"If Q then P\".\n\nOriginal Statement (P → Q): If $x < 0$, then $x^2 - x > 0$.\n\nContrapositive Statement (¬Q → ¬P): If $x^2 - x ≤ 0$, then $x ≥ 0$.\n\nConverse Statement (Q → P): If $x^2 - x > 0$, then $x < 0$.\n\nNow let's examine which of these are true:\n\nOriginal Statement (P → Q): This statement is true. If $x < 0$, the expression $x^2 - x$ will be positive. This is because the term $x^2$ will always be positive and subtracting a negative $x$ (since $x < 0$) effectively becomes addition, making the whole expression positive.\n\nContrapositive Statement (¬Q → ¬P): This should be true as well, because the contrapositive of a statement is logically equivalent to the original statement. If $x^2 - x ≤ 0$, then it implies that $x ≥ 0$. We can verify this by choosing a positive $x$, for instance $x = 1$, which indeed satisfies $x^2 - x ≤ 0$.\n\nConverse Statement (Q → P): This statement is not necessarily true. There are instances where $x^2 - x > 0$ and $x$ is not less than $0$. For example, if $x = 2$, then $x^2 - x = 2^2 - 2 = 2 > 0$, but $x = 2$ is not less than $0$.\n\nSo, the original statement and its contrapositive are true, but the converse is not always true.",

This is a way of defining a set by stating the properties that its members must satisfy.\n\nTo express these sets in terms of $A$, $B$, and $C$ using the symbols $\\cup$ (union), $\\cap$ (intersection), and $\\setminus$ (set difference), we'll need to understand each set's definition and then translate it into the appropriate combination of these operations. Here are the results:\n\nSet $D = {x | x \\in A \\text{ and } (x \\in B \\text{ or } x \\in C)}$\n\nThis description is saying that set D contains all the elements that are both in A and either in B or C.

It includes all elements of A for which the implication \"if x is in B then x is in C\" is true. It's important to remember that an implication is always true if the premise (here, \"x in B\") is false. So, all elements of A that are not in B are included (since the implication is vacuously true for them), and also all elements that are in both B and C. We can express this as $F = A \\cap ((A \\cap B) \\cup (A \\setminus B))$, which is the intersection of A with the union of the intersection of A and B, and the difference between A and B.\n\nThese translations into set operations use the fact that the $\\cap$, $\\cup$, and $\\setminus$ operations correspond to logical and, or, and not, respectively, in the sense of operations on indicator functions or characteristic functions.",

The two laws can be written as follows:\n\n(A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'\n(A ∩ B)' = A' ∪ B'\n\nHere the ' symbol represents the complement of a set, which is the set of all elements in the universal set that are not in the given set. A' is the complement of A, and B' is the complement of B.\n\nProof for arbitrary unions and intersections: Let's generalize DeMorgan’s laws to countably infinite collections of sets. Let I be a non-empty index set, and for each i ∈ I, let Ai be a set. Then DeMorgan's laws become:\n\n(⋃_{i∈I} Ai)' = ⋂_{i∈I} Ai'\n(⋂_{i∈I} Ai)' = ⋃_{i∈I} Ai'\n\nProof:\n\nWe'll prove (⋃_{i∈I} Ai)' = ⋂_{i∈I} Ai'.\n\nLet x ∈ (⋃_{i∈I} Ai)'.

So we have (⋃_{i∈I} Ai)' ⊆ ⋂_{i∈I} Ai'.\n\nConversely, let x ∈ ⋂_{i∈I} Ai'. Then by the definition of intersection, x is in every set Ai', for every i ∈ I.
