To do that, we need to show that for any $x in mathbb{R}$ and any open interval containing $x$, say $(x - epsilon, x + epsilon)$ where $epsilon > 0$, there exists an interval of the form $[a, b) in C$ such that $x in [a, b) subseteq (x - epsilon, x + epsilon)$. Since $a$ and $b$ are rational, we can choose rational numbers $a$ and $b$ such that $x - epsilon < a < x < b < x + epsilon$. Therefore, $x in [a, b) subseteq (x - epsilon, x + epsilon)$ and $C$ is a basis.\n\nNow let's call the topology generated by $C$ the rational lower limit topology, and denote it by $\\tau_C$. The lower limit topology on the real line is generated by all half-open intervals of the form $[a, b)$, where $a, b in mathbb{R}$ and $a < b$, and we will denote it by $\\tau_L$.\n\nTo show that $\\tau_C$ is different from $\\tau_L$, we will find an open set in $\\tau_L$ that cannot be expressed as a union of open sets from $\\tau_C$.

Since $pi$ is irrational, it is not contained in any of the intervals $[a_i, b_i)$. However, for every $epsilon > 0$, there exists an $i in I$ such that $pi - epsilon < a_i < pi < b_i$. Since the intervals are half-open and $pi \\notin [a_i, b_i)$, we have $b_i leq pi$. So, there exists a sequence of rational numbers $b_{i_n}$ such that $b_{i_n} \\to pi$ as $n \\to \\infty$. But $pi$ is a limit point of the union, so it must be included in the open set, which is a contradiction.\n\nThus, $[0, pi)$ cannot be expressed as a union of open sets from $\\tau_C$, which implies that the topology generated by $C$ is different from the lower limit topology on the real line.",
