Then, we will show that any smaller class does not satisfy these properties.\n\nMeasurable functions contain simple functions and are closed under pointwise limits.\n\n(a) Simple functions are measurable: Consider a simple function $\\phi : \\Omega \\to \\mathbb{R}$ defined as $\\phi(x) = \\sum_{i=1}^n c_i \\mathds{1}{A_i}(x)$, where the $c_i$ are real numbers and $A_i$ are measurable sets. Since each $A_i$ is a measurable set, the indicator function $\\mathds{1}{A_i}(x)$ is also measurable. The sum of measurable functions and scalar multiples of measurable functions are also measurable. Thus, $\\phi(x)$ is measurable, and the class of measurable functions contains simple functions.\n\\(b) Measurable functions are closed under pointwise limits: Let ${f_n}$ be a sequence of measurable functions from $\\Omega$ to $\\mathbb{R}$. Suppose that the pointwise limit of this sequence exists, i.e., for every $x \\in \\Omega$, $f(x) = \\lim_{n \\to \\infty} f_n(x)$. We need to show that $f$ is a measurable function.\n\nLet $a \\in \\mathbb{R}$ be an arbitrary real number. We want to show that the set ${x \\in \\Omega \\mid f(x) > a}$ is measurable. Note that for every $x \\in \\Omega$, $f(x) > a$ if and only if there exists some positive integer $N$ such that $f_n(x) > a$ for all $n \\ge N$. Therefore, we can write:\n\n${x \\in \\Omega \\mid f(x) > a} = \\bigcup_{n=1}^\\infty \\bigcap_{k=n}^\\infty {x \\in \\Omega \\mid f_k(x) > a}$.\n\nSince each $f_k$ is a measurable function, the set ${x \\in \\Omega \\mid f_k(x) > a}$ is measurable. The intersection of measurable sets is measurable, and the countable union of measurable sets is measurable. Thus, the set ${x \\in \\Omega \\mid f(x) > a}$ is measurable, and $f$ is a measurable function. Hence, the class of measurable functions is closed under pointwise limits.\n\nAny smaller class does not satisfy these properties.\n\nSuppose there exists a smaller class $\\mathcal{M}$ that contains simple functions and is closed under pointwise limits. Since the class of measurable functions contains simple functions, $\\mathcal{M}$ must also contain simple functions. Now consider a sequence of functions in $\\mathcal{M}$ with pointwise limits. Since $\\mathcal{M}$ is closed under pointwise limits, the limit function must also belong to $\\mathcal{M}$. However, this contradicts the assumption that $\\mathcal{M}$ is a smaller class than the class of measurable functions.\n\nTherefore, the class of measurable functions is the smallest class containing simple functions and being closed under pointwise limits.",

For any two random variables $X$ and $Z$ with finite second moments, the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality states that:\n\n$(E[XZ])^2 le E[X^2]E[Z^2]$.\n\nNow, let's apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to the random variables $Y$ and $mathds{1}{Y > 0}$, where $mathds{1}{Y > 0}$ is the indicator function that takes the value 1 when $Y > 0$ and 0 otherwise.\n\nIn this case, $X = Y$ and $Z = mathds{1}{Y > 0}$. We have $E[Y^2] < infty$ by assumption, and $E[(mathds{1}{Y > 0})^2]$ is finite because the indicator function can only take values 0 and 1. Thus, we can apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:\n\n$(E[Ymathds{1}{Y > 0}])^2 le E[Y^2]E[(mathds{1}{Y > 0})^2]$.\n\nNow let's analyze the expectations:\n\n$E[Ymathds{1}_{Y > 0}] = E[Y]$ because when $Y > 0$, the indicator function is 1, and when $Y le 0$, the indicator function is 0 and the product is also 0.\n$E[(mathds{1}{Y > 0})^2] = E[mathds{1}{Y > 0}]$ because squaring the indicator function does not change its value.\nSo we have:\n\n$(E[Y])^2 le E[Y^2]E[mathds{1}_{Y > 0}]$.\n\nNow we want to get an inequality with $P(Y > 0)$. Recall that $E[mathds{1}_{Y > 0}] = P(Y > 0)$. Thus,\n\n$(E[Y])^2 le E[Y^2]P(Y > 0)$.\n\nDivide both sides by $E[Y^2]$:\n\n$\\frac{(E[Y])^2}{E[Y^2]} le P(Y > 0)$.\n\nFinally, we have:\n\n$P(Y > 0) ge \\frac{(E[Y])^2}{E[Y^2]}$.",
