So, we are given that the quadratic equation:\n\n$x^2 + ax + b = 0$\n\nhas roots $a$ and $b$. Let's use Vieta's formulas, which state that for a quadratic equation of the form:\n\n$x^2 + px + q = 0$\n\nthe sum of the roots is given by $-p$ and the product of the roots is given by $q$. In this case, $p = a$ and $q = b$. So, we have:\n\nSum of roots: $a + b = -a$\nProduct of roots: $ab = b$\n\nNow, let's solve these equations.\n\nFrom the first equation, $a + b = -a$, we get $2a = -b$.\n\nNow, let's substitute this into the second equation, $ab = b$:\n\n$a(-\\frac{1}{2}a) = -\\frac{1}{2}a^2 = b$\n\nNow, we have the values of $a$ and $b$ in terms of each other:\n\n$b = -\\frac{1}{2}a^2$\n\nSince $a$ and $b$ are both nonzero, we know that $a \\neq 0$.
