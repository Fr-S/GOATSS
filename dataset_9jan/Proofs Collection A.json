In order for an $n \\times n$ matrix to be invertible, we need the rows to be linearly independent.  As you note, we have $q^n - 1$ choices for the first row; now, there are $q$ vectors in the span of the first row, so we have $q^n - q$ choices for the second row.  Now, let $v_1, v_2$ be the first two rows.  Then the set of vectors in the span of $v_1, v_2$ is of the form $\\{c_1 v_1 + c_2 v_2 | c_1,c_2 \\in F\\}$.  This set is of size $q^2$, as we have $q$ choices for $c_1$ and $q$ choices for $c_2$.  Thus, we have $q^n - q^2$ choices for the third row.  Continuing this gives the desired formula.
