Therefore, after n steps, there will be only one integer remaining.\nNow, consider any two integers a and b that are erased and replaced with |a-b|. If a and b are both odd or both even, then |a-b| will be even. However, if one of a and b is odd and the other is even, then |a-b| will be odd.\nSince n is odd, there will be an odd number of integers that are either odd or even (one more odd than even). Therefore, at least one of the pairs that is erased and replaced with |a-b| in each step will have one odd and one even integer.\nSince |a-b| will be odd when one of a and b is odd and the other is even, it follows that an odd number will be the final remaining integer on the blackboard.\nHence, we have proved that an odd number will always remain at the end.",

One popular solution is the \"visibility graph\" algorithm, which constructs a graph representing the visibility relationships between the vertices of the polygon, and then solves the problem using a minimum vertex cover algorithm. In general, the minimum number of guards required for a simple n-gon is O(sqrt(n)) and for a general polygon is O(n).",

By assumption, there exists a line $l_4$ that passes through the intersection of $l_1$ and $l_2$, and a line $l_5$ that passes through the intersection of $l_2$ and $l_3$.

This can be done using the formula for $a_n$, with $n$ replaced by $n/2$. The total number of symmetric tilings is thus given by $(n-1)a_{n/2}$.\n\nFor distinct tilings, we can use the Pigeonhole principle, which states that if there are n+1 pigeons and n pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must contain two or more pigeons.\n\nIf we consider two tilings as distinct if they are not rotationally equivalent, then there are $a_n$ ways to tile a $2 \\times n$ rectangle.\n\nAs $n$ is even, there are $n/2$ columns which can be considered as identical, and thus there are $n/2$ pigeonholes.\n\nIf there are $a_n$ tilings, then at least one of the pigeonholes must contain two or more tilings, and thus the number of distinct tilings is at most $a_n - (n/2) + 1$.",

One way to do this is to use the Rational Root Theorem, which states that if a polynomial $p(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + dots + a_1x + a_0$ is reducible over $mathbb{Z}$, then any rational root of $p(x)$ must be of the form $\\frac{a}{b}$, where a is a divisor of $a_0$ and b is a divisor of $a_n$.\n\nIn this case, the polynomial $x^{105}-9$ has leading coefficient $1$ and constant term $-9$, so any rational root of the polynomial must be of the form $\\frac{a}{b}$, where a is a divisor of $-9$ and b is a divisor of $1$. Since $-9 = -3^2$, the divisors of $-9$ are $-1$, $-3$, and $-9$. Therefore, the possible rational roots of $x^{105}-9$ are $-1$, $-3$, $-\\frac{1}{3}$, $-\\frac{1}{9}$, $-\\frac{1}{1}$.\n\nBy checking these roots, we find that the polynomial $x^{105}-9$ does not have any rational roots.
