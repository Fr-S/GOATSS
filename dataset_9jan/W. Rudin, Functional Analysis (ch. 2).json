Since Y is an F-space, the limit of a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous linear mappings is a continuous linear mapping. Thus, the limit $Lambda(x) = lim Lambda_n(x)$ exists for every x in C and defines a continuous linear mapping from X to Y.\nTo show that $Lambda(x) = lim Lambda_n(x)$ exists for every $x in X$, we use the fact that C is dense in X. For any $x in X$, we can find a sequence ${x_n}$ in C such that $x_n \\rightarrow x$. Since $Lambda_n$ is equicontinuous, we have $Lambda_n(x_n) \\rightarrow Lambda(x)$ and $Lambda_n(x) \\rightarrow Lambda(x)$ as $n \\rightarrow infty$. Thus, $Lambda(x) = lim Lambda_n(x)$ exists for every $x in X$.\nFinally, to show that Lambda is continuous, we need to show that for any $x_0 in X$ and any $epsilon > 0$, there exists a neighborhood U of $x_0$ such that $||Lambda(x) - Lambda(x_0)|| < epsilon$ for all $x in U$. Since ${Lambda_n(x)}$ converges uniformly on C, we can find $N$ such that $||Lambda_n(x) - Lambda(x)|| < \\frac{epsilon}{3}$ for all $x in C$ and all $n geq N$. Let $x_0 in X$, we can find $x_1 in C$ such that $||x_1 - x_0|| < \\frac{epsilon}{3||Lambda(x_1)||}$. Thus for any $x in B(x_0,\\frac{epsilon}{3||Lambda(x_1)||})$ we have\n$||x - x_0|| < \\frac{epsilon}{3||Lambda(x_1)||}$\n$||Lambda(x) - Lambda(x_1)|| leq ||Lambda(x) - Lambda_n(x)|| + ||Lambda_n(x) - Lambda(x_1)|| <\\frac{epsilon}{3} + \\frac{epsilon}{3} = \\frac{2}{3}epsilon$\n$||Lambda(x) - Lambda(x_0)|| leq ||Lambda(x) - Lambda(x_1)|| + ||Lambda(x_1) - Lambda(x_0)|| < \\frac{2}{3}epsilon + \\frac{epsilon}{3} = epsilon$\nTherefore, $Lambda$ is continuous on X.",

Since the complement of Y is a countable union of nowhere dense sets, there exists a nowhere dense set S in the complement of Y such that x is in S.\n\nSince S is nowhere dense, there exists an open set U containing x such that the intersection of U and S is empty.
