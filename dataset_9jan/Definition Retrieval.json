This allows for the use of local coordinates, which simplifies the calculation of integrals and derivatives of smooth functions. In general, a partition of unity is a collection of smooth functions {phi_i} on a topological space X that satisfies:\nEach phi_i is supported on a compact subset of X, called the support of phi_i.\nThe support of phi_i is contained in an open set U_i in X.\nThe sum of phi_i(x) over all i is 1 for all x in X.",
