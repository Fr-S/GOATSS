        "output": "To show that addition is $\\tau$-continuous, we must show that the sum of any two elements in a $\\tau$-open set is also in that set. Let $f, g in V(h, r)$, where $V(h, r)$ is a $\\tau$-open set. Then, for all $x in (0, 1)$, we have $|f(x) - h(x)| < r$ and $|g(x) - h(x)| < r$. Thus,\n$|(f + g)(x) - (h + h)(x)| = |f(x) + g(x) - h(x) - h(x)| = |f(x) + g(x) - 2h(x)| le |f(x) - h(x)| + |g(x) - h(x)| < r + r = 2r$\nSo, $f + g in V(h + h, 2r)$, which is also a $\\tau$-open set, and thus addition is $\\tau$-continuous.\n\nTo show that scalar multiplication is not $\\tau$-continuous, we must find a $\\tau$-open set $V(f, r)$ and a scalar $c$ such that $cf \\notin V(f, r)$. For example, let $f(x) = x$ and $r = \\frac{1}{4}$, and let $c = 2$. Then, for all $x in (0, 1)$, we have $|f(x) - 2f(x)| = |x - 2x| = |x| = x > \\frac{1}{4}$, so $cf = 2f \\notin V(f, r)$, and thus scalar multiplication is not $\\tau$-continuous.",
