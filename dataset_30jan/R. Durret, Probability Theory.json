It states that any measurable function $f$ with finite $L^p$ norm ($|f|\\_p < \\infty$) can be approximated arbitrarily closely in the $L^p$ norm by a sequence of simple functions.\n\nThe proof of this theorem involves the construction of a sequence of simple functions $\\phi\\_n$ that converge pointwise to $f$, and the use of the dominated convergence theorem to show that $\\lim\\_{n \\to \\infty} |f - \\phi\\_n|\\_p = 0$.\n\nThe sequence of simple functions can be constructed as follows: for each positive integer $n$, partition the domain of $f$ into $n$ disjoint measurable sets, and assign to each set the average value of $f$ over that set. The resulting function is a simple function that approximates $f$. As $n$ increases, this approximation becomes arbitrarily close.\n\nThe dominated convergence theorem ensures that as $n$ increases, the $L^p$ norm of the difference between $f$ and $\\phi\\_n$ converges to zero, because the simple functions $\\phi\\_n$ form a uniformly bounded sequence and converge pointwise to $f$.\n\nThus, we have shown that any measurable function with finite $L^p$ norm can be approximated arbitrarily closely in the $L^p$ norm by a sequence of simple functions.\n",
