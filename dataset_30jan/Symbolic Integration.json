The fraction (1/(3x)) can be written as 1/3 * (1/x), so we can apply partial fraction decomposition to (1/x). We have:\n (1/3) * (3 + x + x^3) / x = (A/x) + (B/x^2) + (C/x^3)\n Multiplying both sides by x, we get:\n (1/3) * (3 + x + x^3) = A + Bx + Cx^2\n Comparing the coefficients of x^3 on both sides, we get:\n C = 0\n Comparing the coefficients of x^2 on both sides, we get:\n B = 0\n Comparing the coefficients of x on both sides, we get:\n A = 1/3\n So, the partial fraction decomposition of (1/(3x)) * (3 + x + x^3) is:\n (1/(3x)) * (3 + x + x^3) = (1/3) * (1/x) + 0 * (1/x^2) + 0 * (1/x^3)\n Next, we can integrate each fraction individually. The antiderivative of (1/3) * (1/x) is -(1/3) * ln|x| + C, where C is the constant of integration. The antiderivative of (1/(3x)) * (3 + x + x^3) is -(1/3) * ln|x| + (3x) + (x^2) + (x^4)/4 + C, where C is the constant of integration.\n So, the definite integral of (1/(3x)) * (3 + x + x^3) over the interval [a, b] can be written as:\n ∫[a,b] (1/(3x)) * (3 + x + x^3) dx = -(1/3) * [ln|b| - ln|a|] + (3b) + (b^2) + (b^4)/4 - ((3a) + (a^2) + (a^4)/4)",

        "output": "The integral of 1 + 32e^{-x} - 32xe^{-x} can be found using the rules of differentiation and integration. Here's one way to approach it:\n Integrate the first term, which is just a constant:\n ∫1 dx = x + C\n Integrate the second term, 32e^{-x}:\n ∫32e^{-x} dx = 32(-e^{-x}) = 32e^{x}\n Integrate the third term, -32xe^{-x}:\n ∫-32xe^{-x} dx = -32∫xe^{-x} dx\n We can integrate this term by using integration by parts. Let u = x and dv = e^{-x} dx. Then, du = dx and v = -e^{-x}. So, we have:\n -32∫xe^{-x} dx = -32 (xe^{-x} - ∫e^{-x} dx) = -32 (xe^{-x} + e^{x})\n Putting it all together, we have:\n ∫ (1 + 32e^{-x} - 32xe^{-x}) dx = x + 32e^{x} - 32 (xe^{-x} + e^{x}) + C = x + 32e^{x} - 32xe^{-x} - 32e^{x} + C = x - 32xe^{-x} + C\n So, the definite integral of 1 + 32e^{-x} - 32xe^{-x} from a to b can be calculated as:\n ∫_a^b (1 + 32e^{-x} - 32xe^{-x}) dx = b - 32be^{-b} - (a - 32ae^{-a})\n Note that the constant of integration, C, cancels out in the definite integral, so it doesn't affect the result.",
