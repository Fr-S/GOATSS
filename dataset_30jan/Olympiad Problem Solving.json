Consider the case when n+1 numbers are written on the board.\n\nAfter one step, two numbers a and b are erased, and (a+b)/4 is written instead. We know that a and b are both not less than 1/(n+1), so their sum is not less than 2/(n+1). Dividing this sum by 4, we have that (a+b)/4 is not less than 1/(n+1).\n\nTherefore, after n steps, at least one number remains that is not less than 1/(n+1).

It was first proved by Alfred Tarski in 1935.\n\nA formal proof of Tarski's Theorem is quite involved and requires knowledge of geometry and topology. However, one can intuitively understand the theorem by considering the sphere as a two-dimensional surface. On a two-dimensional surface, a continuous region can be divided into smaller regions in a variety of ways. For example, one can divide a region into two regions of equal area. On the sphere, two regions of equal area divide the sphere into two hemispheres, each with the same color. Thus, if we take any great circle that divides the sphere into two hemispheres, we can find three points of the same color on the sphere that are vertices of an equilateral triangle.\n\nIn summary, Tarski's Theorem states that if a sphere is colored in two colors, there exists three points of the same color that are vertices of a regular triangle on the sphere.\n",

            "output": "No, the polynomial $x^{105} - 9$ is not reducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$, meaning it cannot be factored as the product of two or more polynomials with coefficients in $\\mathbb{Z}$. One way to see this is by applying the Eisenstein's Criterion, which states that if a polynomial $f(x)$ in $\\mathbb{Z}\\[x]$ has a coefficient of 1 for the highest-degree term and satisfies the condition $p\\mid f(0)$ for some prime $p$ and $p^2\\nmid f(0)$, then $f(x)$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$. In this case, $f(x) = x^{105} - 9$ has a coefficient of 1 for the highest-degree term and satisfies the condition $3\\mid f(0) = -9$ and $3^2\\nmid f(0) = -9$, so it is irreducible over $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n",
